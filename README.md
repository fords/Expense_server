# Expense Track Full Stack Project

Inspired by Splitwise app created in Rhode Island, the app that keeps track of bills split among friends and family,I created the Expense Track full stack project using single page application Ember and Express framework. The app has the option of adding person's name and creating expense that could be split among the people. The expense could be apartment utilities, hotel stay, trips cost, events tickets cost or any events. The expense has the total amount and people's name list.
